CPNT 262 - Assignment 3 - Objects and Arrays

## Author: Sterling Smith

### Practical use cases
- .push() - You could be adding a value to an existing array of information (ex. adding an email to someones contact info after all the main info has been entered)
- .pop() - When you want to view only certain objects in an array (ex. you only need someones name and age and not their address or email)
- .find() - When you want to find a specific piece of info inside of a given array of objects (ex. if you wanted only someones email out of their personal info)
- Object.values() - When you want to view all the objects in an array (ex. you want to show all of a person's info before submitting an order online)
- Object.entries() - When you want to see all info and entry categories (ex. similar to Object.vales(), you would use this to show a persons info before completing an order online)

    - Really struggled with rendering the code onto the html page. It is important to remember where you are asking the code to render the info (ex. making sure the right elements have the correct class names). Be sure to always triple check that you are trying to render the code to the correct places.

    - Struggled with the "real world" applications of the JavaScript code. It helped a lot to talk through what kinds of info would actually be found in objects and arrays. Rubber Ducky Debugging or talking this through with instructors and classmates is a good way to work through this hang-up.
